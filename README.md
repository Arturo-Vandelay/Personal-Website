# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This repository showcases my open-source projects, highlighting my expertise in web3 development, front-end tools, and automation experiments.

## Developer / Author Intro

I am passionate about decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and memecoins. I provide daily market insights, highlight top trending tokens, and share the best tools in the crypto space. Join me for educational content, live AMAs, and exclusive crypto updates.

## Purpose

This portfolio serves as a comprehensive display of my work in the blockchain and web development space. It includes various projects that demonstrate my skills in decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contract development, and creating user-friendly interfaces for decentralized applications (dApps).
